All WSDOT station locations are based on the detector locations. All ODOT station locations are based on the cabinet locations that are provided through the [TripCheck API](https://www.tripcheck.com/Pages/API). Please [refer to this map](https://geo.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/basic/index.html?appid=41474cf6e00241668e7947f3cbf5076a) to see where the detectors are located that are tied to the cabinets. We are working on updating PORTAL's station locations to better reflect the location of the detectors and not the cabinets. Please [see these slides](https://github.com/adus/portal-documentation/blob/master/assets/pdfs/2023-02-15-CRMS_to_OTMS.pdf) that were presented by Shen Qu (ODOT) at the last PUG meeting (2023-02-15).

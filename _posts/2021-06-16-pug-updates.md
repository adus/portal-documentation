_Presenter_: Dr. Bruce Irvin, PSU  
_Presentation_: In Winter 2021 Portland State University's new Data Engineering course used C-Tran breadcrumb and CAD/AVL stop data for student projects. Student teams implemented fully-functioning data pipelines that gathered, transported, transformed, loaded, queried and visualized hundreds of millions of C-Tran GPS sensor readings. We'll demonstrate some of the impressive results that these students achieved and discuss the lessons that they learned while working with real-world transit data.

PORTAL Updates:
- Re-aggregating historical data: how far back and what level of granularity should be prioritized?
- Re-aggregating duplicates with 1 month granularity: when a new station is installed within a month, the upstream and downstream stations change length. This means that for some part of the month, the upstream and downstream stations have two different lengths for the month which leads to a duplicate record. How should we handle the duplicates?
- Future of Bluemac
- Cross-agency travel time

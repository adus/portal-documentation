Introductions & updates  

2:10 pm - 2:40 pm  
_Presenter_: Dr. Bruce Irvin, PSU  
_Presentation_: In Winter 2021 Portland State University's new Data Engineering course used C-Tran breadcrumb and CAD/AVL stop data for student projects. Student teams implemented fully-functioning data pipelines that gathered, transported, transformed, loaded, queried and visualized hundreds of millions of C-Tran GPS sensor readings. We'll demonstrate some of the impressive results that these students achieved and discuss the lessons that they learned while working with real-world transit data. Slides of the pdf are [here](https://github.com/adus/portal-documentation/blob/master/assets/pdfs/data-engineering-irvin.pdf). Google slides are found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a8ybqzPLvzx2BWUrBvTHvqpG3bqDqHEqyJPrVjHhZhU/edit#slide=id.p).

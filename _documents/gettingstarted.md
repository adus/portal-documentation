title: "Getting Started with the Portal API"
---

The Portal API offers a publicly available means of accessing the data in the Portal archive;
and no token required in order to make a request.

The base URL for the API is:
<br />

`http://new.portal.its.pdx.edu:8080/{endpoint}`
<br /><br />

The following endpoints may be appended to the base URL, in order to access data from specific datasets:
<br />

| endpoint                               | description                                         |
|--------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| /highways/api/freewaydata              | Highway speed and volume data                       |
| /highways/api/stationsmetadata         | Highway station metadata                            |
| /highways/api/detectormetadata         | Highway detector metadata                           |
| /highways/api/highwaymetadata          | Highway metadata                                    |
| /traveltime/api/aggregatedsegmentcalcs | Travel times along highways by segment              |
| /traveltime/api/segmentcalc            | Raw travel time data                                |
| /traveltime/api/seginventory           | List of segments for travel time calculations       | 
| /traveltime/api/dcuinventory           | Bluetooth Data Collection Unit metadata             |
| /freight/api/aggregatedbindata         | Freight data based on vehicle length metrics        |
| /arterial/api/voyagevolume             | Traffic volume data for arterial routes in Portland |
| /transit/downloadquarterlydata         | Download zipped Trimet data for specified quarter   |\

\
 As no token is required for access to the API, a very simple cURL header can be used in order to access this data:

| Header |  Usage  |
| ------ | ------- |
| curl {base URL}/{endpoint}/{query parameters} -H 'Host:new.portal.its.pdx.edu:8080' | Request a dataset from the specified endpoint with the specified query parameters. |

Portal data is served in JSON format by default at almost all endpoints; CSV formatted data is available by request by specifying ```format=csv``` in the request to most of the endpoints. The main exception to this is the Trimet Quarterly Transit Data, which is only served as a zip file containing CSV formatted data.

Details on how to [_API access examples_]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/access_examples/) page. Additional cURL and Python script examples can be found there as well.

All data accessible via the API is also served from the API to the portal website; visiting the documentation pages for [_Vehicle Length (Freight)_]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/freight/), [_Highways_]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/highways/), [_Stations_]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/stations/), and [_Travel Time_]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/travel-time/) can provide a new user of the API some insight into the data parameters.

Additionally, all of the data parameters for each endpoint are listed on the [_Definitions_]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/definitions/) page. Most of the parameters for various API requests are clearly defined on that page (and soon, all of them will be!).  Finally, the metadata available through the ```/highways/api/stationsmetadata```, ```/highways/api/detectormetadata ```, ```/highways/api/highwaymetadata```, and ```/traveltime/api/seginventory``` endpoints is crucial to the success of making API calls for specific locations, as it contains mappings between the real locations of those objects and the unique id values which are referenced in data returned by calls to other endpoints.  This metadata is downloadable both through API calls and via the [_Downloads_]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/downloads/) page.

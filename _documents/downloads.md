## Highways
Highway data can be downloaded from this section by selecting the start and end date of interest, days of week, format, highway of interest, and temporal resolution. Multiple highway sections can be downloaded at once by holding the ctrl key and clicking on the desired highway in the Highway menu.

This data is returned both by the Highways download form on the [_Downloads_](http://new.portal.its.pdx.edu:8080/downloads/) of the Portal website, and by the [_/highways/api/freewaydata_]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/freewaydata/) endpoint of the API.

title: "Stations"
---

The _Stations_ section allows users to get average volume, total volume, speed, occupancy, travel time, vehicle miles traveled for single or multiple stations; and volumes for ramp data.

## Learning objectives
By the end of the tutorial, users will be able to:

* set thresholds to assess station health defined by data availability
* select a mainline and ramp stations using either the map or metadata table
* understand, navigate, and use the filters for visualizing data for two quantities
* understand, navigate, and use the filters for comparing single quantity historical data

### Step 1: Set mainline and ramp station data availability thresholds and date range
Select any single station on the map. The stations are grouped by the direction of traffic (north, south, east, west). Once a station has been selected a pop-up will provide the name of the station and location, and a link to view more information (Figure 1).

PORTAL consists of both a publicly available API and a [_dashboard-driven website_](http://new.portal.its.pdx.edu:8080/downloads/), both of which provide access to the same datasets. The navigation sidebar in this section provides links to various topics of interest, including an overview of the API, its
endpoints and some access examples in various languages.  Additional documentation is provided which details the use of the dashboards on the Portal website.  The [_Downloads_]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/downloads/) page also provides descriptions of the individual attributes of each of the data sets accessible through the dashboard or the API.  Finally, the [_Definitions_]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/definitions/) page provides some insight into the methodologies used in calculating the data in the data sets, as well as other clarifications about the data itself.

Questions or feedback about the API, the PORTAL website, or the Documentation should be directed to askportal@pdx.edu.
